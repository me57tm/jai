A Robot Arena 2 AI desgined to be a more universal AI with more a interesting fighting style. jai attempts to allow the AI to get itself out of bad situations that a human driver would be able to but other AI modes currently don't notice.
Aims to reduce point toward enemy -> drive toward enemy driving behaviour.
Aims to reduce "Microwaves" where above behaviour leads to 2 AI in contact, spinning in place for sometimes minutes straight.
