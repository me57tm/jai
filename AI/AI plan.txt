> Save Robots stuck at 90deg
> Stop AI pinning robots
> Make AI Reset when on top of an opponent if their weapon requires them to be underneath
> Attempt to only use srimech when on the ground to prevent firing into midair and landing with the motors extended
> Allow Spinners to get up to speed dynamically, rather than just at the start of a match, they should be able to move while spinning up rather than just sitting there.
> Should be bidirectional, allow for attacks with rear of robot if available.
> Layers of strategy, when one set of weapons is broken, switch to a backup strategy
> Stop AI spinning out in reverse, (Pathfind to a location backwards rather than just acellerate blindly)
> Prevent "Microwaves" where the turn->accelerate behaviour of the AI causes 2 opponents to pirouette indefinately when they are in contact, but offset and roughly parallel

[> AI Able to actively push opponents towards arena hazards
	-detect if pushing an opponent, turn towards a point between the opponent and the nearest hazard (if the turn is not too great?) then push rather than turn towards enemy then push] - stock AI already does this (although seemingly not too well as I've not noticed)
